[00:38.87] Poor old Johnny Ray
[00:44.48] Sounded sad upon the radio
[00:47.23] Moved a million hearts in mono
[00:49.93] Our mothers cried
[00:54.18] Sang along, who'd blame them?

[01:57.32] So resigned to what their fate is
[02:13.82] 
[01:59.97] But not us (no never)
[02:01.22] No not us (no never)
[02:03.63] We are far too young and clever
[02:19.13] 
[02:07.34] (Remember)
